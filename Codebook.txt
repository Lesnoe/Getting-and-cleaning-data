Raw  data :
    The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
    These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
    Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
    Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
    (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.

 Subject :  number  since 1 to 30 Volanters

Processing  data: read file from directory and create X_test (data.frame)
read "features.txt" for creating  variable names for X_test. Extracting only "mean"
and "std"  variables name to new data.frame. Adding  value Activity for test and Subject  for test
to  the above data.frame. 

The same pul operations makes for  the second part "train" directory.
 Merging   obtained two data.frame together by row.
 Assignment  logical Variables names ("Sitting",Walking"...) to order from 1 till 6 to Activity
 column.  I've got it ,but sometimes is better using numeric value . It can save times,couse of alphabetical 
 processing   can be longer  hence expensive.
 Reshape  data.frame by  melt function  and obtain   data.frame  with  mean value  each  variable for 
 each Subject and  the kind of Activity.
